# Short bio

Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a professional software engineer, currently living and employed in the [Research Triangle Parkway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Triangle_Park). At the moment, I am helping create software used by [millions of library patrons](https://www.ebscohost.com/novelist/our-products/novelist-select) across the globe. I take pride in being a self-starter, a critical thinker, and someone who is easily approachable. I'm a fan of [agile software development](http://www.agilemanifesto.org), extreme programming, and finding the right tool to solve the problem at hand. 

Outside of the software world, I am a huge car enthusiast. When I'm not working on software, I enjoy modifying [cars](/cars), writing about [technology](/notes), and spending time with my wife and Kneesox, our Cornish Rex cat.

Interesting in talking about technology, automobiles or professional development?
