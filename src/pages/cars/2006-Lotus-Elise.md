Growing up, I was no different from most little kids whose bedroom wall was filled with posters of exotic Italian sports cars. As I grew older and become more knowledgeable on all of the costs of owning a car I quickly realized that the sticker shock is just the beginning of owning an exotic. My _practical_ dream car has always been a Lotus Elise or Exige. In my opinion, these cars check off everyone of the requirements for a proper sports car. 

* Lightweight
* Rear-wheel Drive
* Manual gearbox
* Removable top

After a year long search, I found this beautiful 2006 Chili Red Lotus Elise offered for sale by Chequered Flag, a dealership located in Marina Del-Ray, California, who specializes in exotics and classic cars.

In addition to shipping a vehicle, this was the first time I've ever purchased an out of state car. Naturally, my car was located at nearly the furthest distance away from the east coast - beautiful Marina Del-Ray, California. 

## FAQ
Since owning the Lotus, I've received many different questions about the size of the car, driving experience, maintenance costs, etc. 

#### Just how small is the Lotus?
Very small. The vehicle itself is shorter and wider than a Mazda Miata. Inside is a different story. You've got two bucket seats, which hold myself (5"9) and my wife (5"2) perfectly, and _thats it_. 

* If you're larger than a 36" waist you may find the seats slightly uncomfortable
* Neither of the seats recline; both seats are fixed-back bucket seats
* The passenger seat is completely fixed - it doesn't move at all!

#### What type of maintenance is required?
My experience so far has been nothing above ordinary for a car of this type. The Toyota engine is very easy to perform standard operations on, such as a oil changes and spark plugs.
