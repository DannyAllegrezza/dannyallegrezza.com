Growing up, I was like many other little kids who had big dreams of owning a bright red Ferrari or Lamborghini. As I grew older, I realized what was required to own an Italian exotic. My _practical_ dream car has always been a Lotus. These British cars are exactly what I've always wanted in a sports car;

* Lightweight
* Rear-wheel Drive
* Manual gearbox
* Removable top

After a year long search, I found this beautiful 2006 Chili Red Lotus Elise offered for sale by Chequered Flag, a dealership located in Marina Del-Ray, California, who specializes in exotics and classic cars.

## The purchasing experience

The driving experience offered is likely the most fun you can have in any automobile! 


## FAQ
Since owning the Lotus, I've received many different questions about the size of the car, driving experience, etc. 


#### Just how small is the Lotus?
The vehicle itself is shorter and wider than a Mazda Miata. Inside is a different story. You've got two bucket seats which hold myself (5"9) and my wife (5"2) perfectly. 

* If you're larger than a 36" waist you may find the seats slightly uncomfortable
* The passenger seat is completely fixed - it doesn't move at all!
* Neither of the seats recline; both seats are fixed-back bucket seats
