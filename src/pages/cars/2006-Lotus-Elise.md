After selling my red 2JZ 240SX I went on the hunt for my next car: a Lotus Elise. These British built sports cars seemed to meet all of my requirements:

✅Lightweight\
✅Rear-wheel Drive\
✅Manual gearbox\
✅Removable top

After a year long search, I found this beautiful 2006 Chili Red Lotus Elise offered for sale by Chequered Flag, a dealership located in Marina Del-Ray, California, who specializes in exotics and classic cars.

## FAQ

Since owning the Lotus, I've received many different questions about the size of the car, driving experience, etc. 

#### Just how small is the Lotus?

The vehicle itself is shorter and wider than a Mazda Miata. Inside is a different story. You've got two bucket seats which hold myself (5"9) and my wife (5"2) perfectly. 

* If you're larger than a 36" waist you may find the seats slightly uncomfortable
* The passenger seat is completely fixed - it doesn't move at all!
* Neither of the seats recline; both seats are fixed-back bucket seats
