I'm so glad you asked! I'm a full-time software engineer, currently living and working in the [Research Triangle Parkway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Triangle_Park). I'm currently employed at NoveList, a division of EBSCO Industries, working on software used by [millions of library patrons](https://www.ebscohost.com/novelist/our-products/novelist-select) world wide.

## Work Experience

My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dannyallegrezza/) profile gives a great overview of my professional work experience. As of recent, I've been working on integrating systems and server-side development. I have spent a lot of time working in the .NET ecosystem, primarily using C#. I have experience with WinForms, WPF, Web Services, Web API and ASP.NET MVC. 

I've worked with additional languages including Java, PHP and some Go. Ultimately, I prefer whatever language is best fit to solve the problem at hand.
