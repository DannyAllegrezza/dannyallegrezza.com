I'm an avid listener of [Weekly Dev Tips](http://www.weeklydevtips.com), a podcast created by [Steve Smith (AKA Ardalis)](http://ardalis.com), one of my favorite software engineers. He recently released an episode called ["Be Thankful and Show Gratitude"](http://www.weeklydevtips.com/013). I highly recommend you listen to this short 6 minute episode. These are a few of the things I am grateful for:

* My co-workers and fellow engineers who have helped me along the way
* Continuing education sites like [Pluralsight.com](http://www.pluralsight.com) and [Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com)
* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
* Podcasts such as [DotNetRocks](http://www.dotnetrocks.com), [Software Engineering Daily](http://www.softwareengineeringdaily.com) and [Weekly Dev Tips](http://www.weeklydevtips.com) to name a few

I'm beyond grateful for all of the resources that I use daily. It's a wonderful time to be a software developer. To quote John Carmack:

> In the information age, the barriers \[to entry into programming] just aren't there. The barriers are self imposed. If you want to set off and go develop some grand new thing, you don't need millions of dollars of capitalization. You need enough pizza and Diet Coke to stick in your refrigerator, a cheap PC to work on, and the dedication to go through with it. — John Carmack
