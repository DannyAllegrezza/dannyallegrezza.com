I've been using Tailwind CSS for the better part of a year now and while it has it's own quirks, it is hard to deny how convenient a utility-first CSS framework can be! Templates for common layouts and use-cases are quite common in the Tailwind ecosystem. They can help boost your speed while rapidly prototyping a proof of concept and also serve as design inspiration.

For me, I personally find value in exploring the CSS utilized to produce different responsive designs. I wanted to share this quick tip of some of the different Tailwind CSS templates I have found. Some are free, others are paid.


First, let's start with the **official** option, [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com/templates). Tailwind UI contains a set of templates and individual Components that were designed and made available from the official Tailwind team.
