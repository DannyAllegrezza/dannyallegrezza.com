Ever since selling off my 240SX, I've been itching to get my hands on a new project car. I stumbled across this 2004 Mazdaspeed Miata while browsing FB Marketplace. The details seemed intriguing; one owner, 72k miles, bone stock. 

I contacted the owner (who happened to be a soon to be retired 69 year old woman) and setup a time to checkout the car. After arriving at our meeting place, I saw the bright red Miata parked in the corner of the parking lot. After a twenty minute test drive I was ready to make a deal! Mechanically, the car is great. Transmission shifts like all Miata's I've ever driven: beautiful! The main flaws are almost entirely cosmetic. The exterior needs some love, which I'm happy to provide.

I'll be posting updates periodically, so stay tuned!
