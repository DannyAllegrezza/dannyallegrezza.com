My wife and I have one fur-baby: Kneesox, our [Cornish Rex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornish_Rex) cat. She's ~~kind of~~ a big deal and brings us both an incredible amount of joy. It's pretty safe to say that we're both pretty obsessed with her (see: the metal art I created for my wife of her or the catio I built).
