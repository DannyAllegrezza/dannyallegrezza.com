# Templates - what are they for?
This directory contains page/item templates, specifically built for use of the Netlify CMS. The Netlify CMS backend allows you to create and preview your different media types (ex: a `page`, a `blog-post`, etc.)

* These represent the actual content of the given page/item. For example, `blog-post.js` contains a template for rendering a specific individual blog post (ex: `blog/2019-02-27-engineering-meeting-ðŸ‘Œ/`) as well as the preview page inside of the Netlify CMS backend.
